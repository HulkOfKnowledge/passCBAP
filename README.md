# Project Name: passCBAP

## Description
passCBAP is a web application designed to help users prepare for the CBAP (Certified Business Analysis Professional) exams. It provides a mock exam environment where users can practice and test their knowledge. The application includes features such as login and signup functionality, a forget password feature, and a functional contact form integrated with Mailtrap. Users have the option to take the default exam mode, which consists of 120 questions to be answered within 210 minutes. Alternatively, they can customize their own exam mode with a minimum requirement of 30 questions to be completed within 5 minutes. The user's exam history is displayed on the dashboard, allowing them to review and analyze their past exam performances.
